This is a practice project To-do list project!
Here I test adding several more complex (than beginner stuff) features such as pagination & localstorage.

This project contains:
  - Create, toggle hide Added or Finished tasks and move them from one another (as well as delete)
  - Pagination for both Added & Finished task rows
  - Switch 3 different colors
  - Toggle hide description, finished/added tasks

Will add:
  - When description is hidden, more tasks will be displayed as they're smaller
  - Download localstorage data so that you may clear cache and save tasks (uploading then obviously comes with)
  - Maybe adding tags & searchbar if I feel like it
  - Maybe adding an entirely seperate page for projects where you can add tasks for diff projects

Pain points:
  - No error handling for corrupt localstorage etc
  - Messy massive script
  - Next time I might try using JS classes (though I don't entirely know what that is)
  - A little bit repetitive code
