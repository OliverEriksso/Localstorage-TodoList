This is a practice project To-do list!
Here I test adding more complex features than I know, such as pagination & localstorage.

This project contains:
  - Create, toggle hide Added or Finished tasks and move them from one another (as well as delete)
  - Pagination for both Added & Finished task rows
  - Switch 3 different colors
  - Toggle hide description, finished/added tasks

Will add:
  - When description is hidden, more tasks will be displayed as they're smaller
  - Download localstorage data so that you may clear cache and save tasks (uploading then obviously comes with)
  - Probably gonna add so you can drag and drop? Maybe a bit useless for this project but it would be fun to try making it
  - Maybe adding tags & searchbar if I feel like it
  - Maybe adding an entirely separate page for projects where you can add tasks for diff projects

Pain points:
  - No error handling for corrupt local storage etc
  - Messy massive script
  - Next time I might try using JS classes (though I don't entirely know what that is)
  - A little bitof  repetitive code
